=========

Payments through PayPal Express Checkout Smart Payment Buttons are now available for Event Espresso.

Receive payments for event registrations through Venmo
Venmo is now a service provided by PayPal. By using the PayPal Express Checkout Smart Payment Buttons payment gateway, an attendee will be able to pay for their event registrations using Venmo. 

With PayPal Express Checkout that is included with Event Espresso, an attendee is temporarily taken to a secure page on PayPal.com where they can pay with a credit card, debit card, or PayPal funds. With the new Smart Payment Buttons, an attendee or a registrant won’t leave your website. Instead, they’ll see a secure modal window appear over your website where they can pay and see a confirmation of their payment and registration right away. On mobile devices, attendees will pay on a page and then see their registration confirmation.
