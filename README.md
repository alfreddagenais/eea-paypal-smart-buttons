EE4 PayPal Express Checkout Smart Payment Buttons (with Venmo)
=========

PayPal Express Checkoutâ€™s Smart Payment Buttons feature gives event organizers a variety of ways to customize payment buttons on the checkout page, including the option to pay for their event registrations with Venmo.

With Smart Payment Buttons, you can choose:

    The size, color, and shape of not just your PayPal checkout button, but also buttons for other, multiple alternative payment methods such as PayPal Credit, Venmo, and local funding sources.
    The language that appears on the buttons (determined by one of 23 locales you can select).
    The button layout you prefer: horizontal or vertical.

Based on your specific configuration and a buyer's location and cookies, Express Checkout dynamically presents the appropriate funding sources to give your buyers more ways to pay.
